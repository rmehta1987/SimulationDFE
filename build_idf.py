    """Builds Integer Discrete flows p(x|y).  Using Simulation Based Inference API.
    Args:
        batch_x: Batch of xs, used to infer dimensionality and (optional) z-scoring.
        batch_y: Batch of ys, used to infer dimensionality and (optional) z-scoring.
        z_score_x: Whether to z-score xs passing into the network, can be one of:
            - `none`, or None: do not z-score.
            - `independent`: z-score each dimension independently.
            - `structured`: treat dimensions as related, therefore compute mean and std
            over the entire batch, instead of per-dimension. Should be used when each
            sample is, for example, a time series or an image.
        z_score_y: Whether to z-score ys passing into the network, same options as
            z_score_x.
        hidden_features: Number of hidden features.
        num_transforms: Number of transforms.
        embedding_net: Optional embedding network for y.
        num_blocks: number of blocks used for residual net for context embedding.
        dropout_probability: dropout probability for regularization in residual net.
        use_batch_norm: whether to use batch norm in residual net.
        kwargs: Additional arguments that are passed by the build function but are not
            relevant for maf and are therefore ignored.
    Returns:
        Neural network.
